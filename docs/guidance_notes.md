**Area charts** — compare current period with same period last year.

---

## 📘 Current Period Page
**KPI Overview (left)** — key KPIs for the current period.  

**Daily performance trends for MINS and CAPES** — target calculated as:  
> **Daily Target = Period Target ÷ 28**

## 📘 Incident Analysis Page
**Root Cause Table** (sortable; default by MINS):  
- Root Cause, MINS, Primary/Reactionary Mins, CAPES, Full/Part Cancels, TINS  

**Drill‑through:**  
- Click a root cause → *“Click here to get detailed info on incidents”* → detailed incident table:  
  - Incident No, Date, Total/Primary/Reactionary Mins, Cancellations (full/part), Location, Memo  
  - Click Incident No → page showing impact by delay location

**TINS by Line of Route (LOR)** — filterable by selected root causes.  
**Major Incident Locations (Map)** — bubble size = number of TINS.

---

## 📘 Department Analysis Page
**Filters** — Subfunction; **Bugle Manager Title** (e.g., Drivers South → Valley Drivers, etc.).  

**Major Root Causes by TINS** (bar chart):  
- Drill‑through: *“Click to get detailed info about payee”* → Payee Name, Train Description, Date, Memo  
- Page filterable by Payee Name  
- Use to monitor patterns (e.g., recurring Cab Setup Issues) for targeted training

**Headcode by TINS** (bar)  
**Payees with Highest TINS** (bar; hover reveals major associated root causes)  
**Major Incident Locations** (map; bubble size = number of TINS)

---

## 📘 NULL Report Page
**Purpose** — Identify functions with **NULL reports** in the last 7 days and enforce investigations within the attribution window.

**7‑day Attribution Window** — Delay Attribution Team must annotate a root cause within 7 days.

**Visuals**  
- **Matrix** — Rows: Bugle Manager Title; Columns: days left to attribute  
- **KPI Cards** — Overdue, 1 Day Left, 2+ Days Left  
- **Incidents by Area & Days Left** (bar)
