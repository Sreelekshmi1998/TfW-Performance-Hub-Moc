## 📌 Overview
A centralised **Power BI** solution that integrates KPIs across multiple functions-Drivers, Conductors, Fleet, Train Planning, Resources, Control, and Station Operations. The hub enables leadership to track **TINS (incidents), MINS (delay minutes), CAPES (cancellations)**, investigate root causes, and compare performance against targets and prior periods.

2. **Current Period** - Daily progression for MINS/CAPES, incident causes tooltips, incident location map.  
3. **Incident Analysis** - Root cause table with drill‑through to incident details; TINS by Line of Route; major locations.
